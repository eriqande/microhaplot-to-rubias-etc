```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a quick repository with some reproducible examples and explanations
about how one might convert output from
[microhaplot](https://github.com/ngthomas/microhaplot) to some commonly used format.

For now, I am just going to show how to do that for putting things into
[rubias](https://github.com/eriqande/rubias) format.

This was inspired by the enjoyable
[blog post](https://johnbhorne.wordpress.com/2019/03/22/snp-haplotypes-for-mixed-stock-fishery-analysis-microhaplot-to-rubias-conversion-in-r/) that John B. Horne made
about the topic in his blog,
[The Marine Biologist at the Breakfast Table](https://johnbhorne.wordpress.com/).

Presently, John is an NRC Postdoc at NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science
Center, and we are super happy to have him!
